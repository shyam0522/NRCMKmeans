## PROJECT TITLE: 
        Analysis and predection of"Mallcustomers. cv" of american mall markets called as phonix Mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular a shop on the basis of these predection of anual income vas spending score
        
## DISCLIMER:
     In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centroide and spending score from the range 1 to 100 calld as datanodes of the clusters

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
        The American finance market as per the GDPof 2011 "phone_trillums" Mall as in the first ~ range out of five. The owner of the Mall wants to be exact which particular shop or product search in different kinds of clusters in entire Mall As a Data Science engineer predict the futuristic finanical market for upcoming GDP rate based on number of clusters The client want atleast five top clusters(shops).

## CONCLUSION:
     According to the model basics predections using machine learning alogorithm kmeans clustering we found that clusters were which consist red color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 datanodes.

## REFERENCES:
The model buliding algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values. The yellow spots represents centroids which is max TO max 3
